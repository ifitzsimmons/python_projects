This module calculates the similarity between States/US Territories and returns the most similar and least similar 
states/territories. The number of results returned is dependent on the integer argument provided for `--top-results`. This module works with 
the data set in the `data` directory and calculates similarity based on distribution of the population across the 
provided races.
